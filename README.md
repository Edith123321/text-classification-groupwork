# SMS Spam Classification with LSTM

Comprehensive implementation of LSTM neural network for SMS spam classification comparing three different embedding techniques: TF-IDF, Skip-gram Word2Vec, and CBOW Word2Vec.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham). The implementation compares three different word embedding approaches to demonstrate the impact of embedding choice on classification performance.
